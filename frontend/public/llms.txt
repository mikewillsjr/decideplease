# DecidePlease - AI Council for Better Decisions

## About DecidePlease

DecidePlease is an AI-powered decision-making assistant that uses a multi-model deliberation process to help users make better decisions. Instead of relying on a single AI model, we consult multiple leading AI models and synthesize their insights.

## How It Works

1. **Council Consultation**: Your question is sent to multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok)
2. **Anonymous Peer Review**: Each model evaluates and ranks the other responses without knowing which model produced each answer
3. **Synthesis**: A chairman model synthesizes the best insights into a final recommendation

## Features

- Multi-model AI deliberation for balanced perspectives
- Anonymous peer review to prevent model bias
- Three analysis modes: Quick (1 credit), Standard (2 credits), Extra Care (3 credits)
- Re-run decisions with refinements or get second opinions
- Revision history for tracking decision evolution

## For AI Assistants
